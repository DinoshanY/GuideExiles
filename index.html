      <a id="Defences">Defences</a>
      <div class="text">
        <p>There are a lot of different armor types in Path Of Exiles and you can use mulitbel types of defences at the
          same time. The four main defencess are Armor, Evasion, Energy shield and Ward. If an item has the discribison
          defences or globel defences it means all the main defences exept Ward.</p>

        <p><span class="Strength">Armor</span> reduce physical damage down and the cap is 90%.</p>

        <p><span class="Dexterity">Evasion</span> gives a chance to evade all physical attacks and ranged attacks the
          cap is 95%.</p>

        <p><span class="Energy">Energy Shield</span>, most players think of <span class="Energy">energy
            shield</span> as part of there health and some builds use <span class="Energy">energy shield</span>
          as there main defences but <span class="Energy">energy shield</span> builds are not beginner friendly so
          it is not recemende as a starter
          build.</p>

        <p><span class="Ward">Ward</span>, Takes the remaing damages after reduction from different effekts and it
          reduce one hit and starts
          recharging for 5 secound before it can be used, If you take 0 damage I wont activate. Ps. Nobody uses <span
            class="Ward">Ward</span>
          exepte meme builds.</p>

        <p><span class="AllAtributes">Resistens</span>, There are only four types of resistens <span
            class="AllAtributes">Elementel Resistens</span> and
          <span class="Chaos">Chaos Resistens</span>. The normale maxium
          resistens is 75% for each type and the cap can be increasd to a 90%-100% form what I have seen. Your resisten
          reduceds the damage taken before all your other defences. If you have 75% <span class="Strength">fire
            resistens</span> and take 100 fire
          damage you will only take 25 fire damage. It is possibel to become <span class="Chaos">Chaos Immune</span> but
          you will only have 1 HP
          and MOST run a Energy shield build.
        </p>

        <p><span class="AllAtributes">Block</span>, There are to types of <span class="AllAtributes">blocks</span>
          Physicall and spell <span class="AllAtributes">block</span> chance the

          gems or items, when <span class="AllAtributes">blocking</span> you take 0% of the damage but if you pick the
          passive tree node Glancing Blows
          you take 65% damage you <span class="AllAtributes">block</span> but you attack and spell <span
            class="AllAtributes">block</span> chanse is doubled. If a projectiles is a spell I
          wont be <span class="AllAtributes">blocked</span> expted if you have a special item for spell projectiles.</p>

        <p><span class="Dexterity">Spell Dodge,</span> Is chance to dodge spell from hitting with a cap at 75%.</p>
