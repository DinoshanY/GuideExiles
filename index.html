      <a id="Defences">Defences</a>
      <div class="text">
        <p>There are a lot of different armor types in Path Of Exiles and you can use mulitbel types of defences at the
          same time. The four main defencess are Armor, Evasion, Energy shield and Ward. If an item has the discribison
          defences or globel defences it means all the main defences exept Ward.</p>

        <p><span class="Strength">Armor</span> reduce physical damage down and the cap is 90%.</p>

        <p><span class="Dexterity">Evasion</span> gives a chance to evade all physical attacks and ranged attacks the
          cap is 95%.</p>

        <p><span class="Energy">Energy Shield</span>, most players think of energy shield as part of there health and
          some builds use energy shield as there main defences but energy shield builds are not beginner friendly so it
          is not recemende as a starter build.</p>

        <p><span class="Ward">Ward</span>, Takes the remaing damages after reduction from different effekts and it
          reduce one hit and starts
          recharging for 5 secound before it can be used, If you take 0 damage I wont activate. Ps. Nobody uses Ward
          exepte meme builds.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Resistens</span>, There are only four types of resistens Elementel Resistens and Chaos
          Resistens. The normale maxium
          resistens is 75% for each type and the cap can be increasd to a 90%-100% form what I have seen. Your resisten
          reduceds the damage taken before all your other defences. If you have 75% fire resistens and take 100 fire
          damage you will only take 25 fire damage. It is possibel to become Chaos Immune but
          you will only have 1 HP
          and MOST run a Energy shield build.
        </p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Block</span>, There are to types of blocks
          Physicall and spell block chance the
          cap
          is 75% butt can be increasd with
          gems or items, when blocking you take 0% of the damage but if you pick the
          passive tree node Glancing Blows
          you take 65% damage you block but you attack and spell block chanse is doubled. If a projectiles is a spell I
          wont be blocked expted if you have a special item for spell projectiles.</p>

        <p><span class="Dexterity">Spell Dodge,</span> Is chance to dodge spell from hitting with a cap at 75%.</p>

        <p><span class="Dexterity">Spell suppression</span>, Is chance to take half of spell damage the cap is 100%.</p>

        <p><span class="Magic">Flask</span>, There a lot of different flasks, and each flask has a different
          effekt, Some give speed, increasd damage
          or the different denfences type, in a normale build you pick one speed flask, One
          health/mana flask and 3 to
          2 defences flasks and maybe a damage flask.</p>

        <p><span class="Uniqe">Immunity</span>, You can get Immunity to a lot lot of
          different effekts like bleed,
          poisions and many many more
          effekts and damages. You get Immunity if the item has the discribsen of Immune to, Immunity to, or Cannot be.
          The most important Immunity is bleed, poision and stun.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Alliments</span>, Are effekts that elements does, the cold element does the
          alliment chill that slows the player and
          freze stops the player for a few secounds. Some items/Passive skill nodes and accendensy passives can make the
          player Alliment Immune the most important Immunity is
          freze and ingnite.</p>

        <p><span class="Chaos">Curse</span>, reduced Effect of curses. Makes it that you will
          still get cursed bet it
          will be reduced the cap is
          100%. with 100% reduced Effect of curses you will get cures but without the debuff.
        </p>

        <p><span class="Gems">Gems</span>, There are a lot of defensiv skill gems used to make
          your build
          tankier the most used gems are, Molten
          Shell, Enduring Cry and Immortal Call. Normally the gems are connected to a Cast
          when Damage Taken Support or
          CWDT for short and the skill will use mana.</p>

        <p><span class="Gems">Aura</span>, There are a lot of defensiv aure is Path of Exiles and you just need
          to pick which suits you the most.
          The most used defensiv used on almost all builds are Determination and Defiance Banner (do not place the
          banner). Auras reservs a Prosent of your mana But it can be lowerd with items,
          Passive skill node and a
          expensive support gem.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Dot</span>, There are multipel Damage over time types. The most dangeres are
          Bleed, Poision and Fire. </p>

    <div class="guides col- col-s-6">
      <a id="Damage">Damage</a>
      <div class="text">

        <p>There are a lot of ways in Path of Exiles to do damage but there are only two types of damage attack
          and spell damage.</p>

        <p><span class="Strength">Attack Damage</span>, Are any skill the has a physical reqiurement and most minions.
        </p>

        <p><span class="Gems">Spell Damage</span>, Are skills you only need slots for without physical requirements and
          some minions.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Elements</span>, There are 3 Elements you can pick between Fire, Cold and Lightning.
          All the elements does one or
          two alliments, Fire dose Ignite. Cold dose Chill and Freze And Lightning does Shock. Ignite dose fire dot,
          Chill slows enemys and freze stops enemy from moving and shock increses the damage enemys take.</p>

        <p><span class="Chaos">Chaos</span>, It attcks the health direcly and ignors enemys energy shield. Chaos damage
          dose not make you do
          poision damage but it dose increas posion damage.</p>

        <p><span class="Strength">Physical</span>, Has a lot of support but is complicated to play a pure physical build
          on your fist playthrow
          because elements and chaos are super strong and dose not need a good build to be good.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Dot</span>, Damage over time builds are puplare because you can attack ones and the
          enemy will countine to take
          damage while you can focuse on dodgeing the enemys attaks. All the elements, chaos and physical damage can be
          dot if you use the right skill.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Trap</span>, are a type of skill you place and the enemy need to triger it.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Mine</span>, are a type of skill you place and you can detonate every mine you place.
        </p>

        <p><span class="Poision">Poision</span>, is a popluar because it is easy to stack and has a long duration with
          decent damage. Can incread
          posision damage with chaos damage.</p>

        <p><span class="Bleed">Bleed</span>, is popluar because it dose a lot of damage and there are a lot of ways to
          increasd its damage from
          different sources.</p>

        <p><span class="Chaos">Curses</span>, You can curse enemies so that they take more damage from you main attack.
          You can also curse enemis
          so when they die you get a small buff.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">Aura</span>, There are a lot of damage auras almost one for each elements, some
          physical, some for spells, some for
          dot and a gem that makes curses auras that effekts enemis and not you.</p>

        <p><span class="Rare">Weapon</span>, There are a lot of different weapons you can chose from. Aslong as you
          chosse one that increases you
          main damage skill. And if you use a one handed weapon you can also use a sheild for more defences.</p>

        <p><span class="textBold">How to know if support gem works</span>, When you hovor over det support skill it will
          show a the gems you are
          currently using and if a green check marks is on the side the support gem can be used but if there a red x on
